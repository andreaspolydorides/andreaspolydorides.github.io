Through the satellite location system, during emergencies, first responders are informed of needs and can act in real time to reach out to all those registered georeferentially.",
        "Cocreation aspect": "In 2011, the government conducted, through the Operational Emergency Committee “Manuela Espejo,” a high-tech tsunami evacuation drill during an emergency warning alert. About 80 mobile vehicles were available to the brigades, as well as a team of 59 doctors, support, and military personnel, guided from a satellite control room based at the Vice Presidential Office in Quito, which worked to evacuate 603 PWDs in critical condition and safely re-locate them into shelters.\n Furthermore, in December 2018, the Servicio Nacional de Gestión de Riesgos y Emergencias announced that a new geodemographic digital platform was put in place. \n At the local level, additional technological improvements were announced in March 2019, such as the installation of a new Cartographic Information Center of the Military Geographical Institute to integrate and georeference flooded areas, and those highly vulnerable to flooding, in the coastal parish of Manabí.\n The use of advanced technology is complemented by a series of institutional, educational, and informational activities to strengthen communities which are carried out in the context of the Strategic Risk Management Plan 2019–2030, the National Response Plan to Disasters, contingency plans, and the recently launched new social intervention program, Plan Toda una Vida, overseen by Ecuador’s First Lady, which includes seven missions—among them the rebranded “Misión Las Manuelas,” conceived as a public policy aimed at PWDs.\n \n Among relevant activities and tools are, at the local level, the creation of Community Committees, trained in prevention and self-protection measures, with the participation of PWDs and their caregivers; the release of a “Guide for the Protection of PWDs in Emergencies and Disasters”; and the launch of the Ecuador Listo y Solidario (Ecuador Ready and Caring) emergency response campaign via web and social networks",
        "Value and usefulness to the user": "According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) (n.d.), “while different populations may face similar risks of exposure to the negative effects of environmental and man-made disasters, their actual vulnerability is dependent on their socioeconomic conditions, civic and social empowerment, and access to mitigation and relief resources.” Experience reveals that disasters affect PWDs much more than the general populations. PWDs are more likely to be left behind or abandoned during evacuations; to experience inaccessible facilities such as shelters and transportation services; and to be discriminated against when resources are scarce.\n \n This policy allows people with disabilities to be located by the government and saved from de a d in the event of a natural disaster.",

Considering the close relationship of these nations, as well as the partnership that exists between Caribbean universities, ITU forecasts that the experiences gained and the capabilities created in Guyana will be exported to its fellow countries, contributing to achieving a more inclusive digital environment for PWDs and those with age-related disabilities. With the support of ITU, the Ministry of Public Telecommunications (MOPT) in Guyana intends to review the pertinent legislation and make the necessary changes, while inspiring other countries to implement similar policies (ITU Telecommunication Development Sector, n.d.).
